## ðŸ“Œ About This Project

An OTP (One-Time Password) generator script, built in April 2025. It generates a 4-digit OTP for a 10-digit phone number and validates user input for a basic login system.

## Why I Built This

- To practice generating random numbers with Pythonâ€™s `random` and `string` modules.  
- To learn input validation with `len()` and `isdigit()`.  
- To create a practical tool for a micro-internship login system.

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Takes a 10-digit phone number as input (e.g., "9876543210").  
- Validates the phone number (must be 10 digits, all numeric).  
- Generates a 4-digit OTP and displays it.  
- Prompts for OTP input and checks if it matches.  
- Prints "Validated Successfully" or "Incorrect otp, not validated".

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- Using `random.choices()` to generate a 4-digit OTP.  
- Validating phone number length and digits with `len()` and `isdigit()`.  
- Building a simple validation flow with conditional checks.
